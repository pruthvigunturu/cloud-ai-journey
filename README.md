## üöÄ About This Project

This project is my personal learning logbook. I started it to keep track of all the new concepts, code snippets, and projects I work on as I explore cloud platforms like AWS and AI concepts like machine learning.

## üéØ My Learning Goals

Here's a list of the skills and technologies I plan to learn during this journey. I'll check them off as I go!

- [ ] **Cloud Fundamentals**
  - [ ] Understand the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
  - [ ] Learn about core AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM).
- [ ] **Programming for AI**
  - [ ] Get comfortable with Python.
  - [ ] Learn about data libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Basics**
  - [ ] Understand what a machine learning model is.
  - [ ] Build a simple prediction model using Scikit-learn.
- [ ] **Containerization**
  - [ ] Learn what Docker is and why it's used.
